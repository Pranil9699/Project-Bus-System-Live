                There were long queues to book tickets that were time-consuming as well as tiring. 
                Booking tickets via telephone was a difficult task because the telephone line remains either out of service or busy most of the time. 
                But the time has changed. There are plenty of luxurious buses available now, 
                providing the best and efficient services to the customers.
